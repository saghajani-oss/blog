              Technology has become dishy for the splendidness of its
              advancement and spellbinding charisma. All of us are certainly
              amazed when it comes to robots. The technical feasibilities of
              computer robots are mesmerizing. Still, this must be kept in mind
              that human is the begetter of a tech boot. Can creation replace
              creator? this question itself seems so irrational but humans
              become tedious to rewind this.

              The major reason the festivals bring happiness and joy is the
              conditioning of the mind. Since birth, our mind is sync with all
              the known festivals for joy, celebrations, and togetherness.
              Festivities encourage a response in our mind regarding
              celebration, happiness, forgiveness, becoming spiritual, and much
              more. If we are in such a situation, it is natural that our minds
              and soul will celebrate.

              Think of something creative that you enjoy doing. Perhaps it’s
              dance, painting, or creating music. How do you feel when you are

              Art has an incredible way of connecting the world and allowing us
              to express ourselves. Because of these feel-good effects, art is a
              powerful tool for self-care and mental health.
